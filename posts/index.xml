Yet, every example of reality is a contradiction to the above stated, a sort of proof that my actions reflect the intention to escape my own consciousness. So, I think I can define this as a search for answers, or pure understanding of myself and what led me to be like this, what is actually going on, how it hurts me, are there alternatives, and, most importantly, am I alone?</description></item><item><title>Understanding changes</title><link>https://gadiborovich.github.io/posts/changes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 14:02:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://gadiborovich.github.io/posts/changes/</guid><description>I need to put some emotions into words that I yet have to identify, describe, and share with myself.
