Sure, everyone says we need to adapt, and while true, I think the phenomenon in itself – going through a recession for the first time – is a key paradigm shift for all of us first-timers. I’ll try capturing some of it here through my personal experience.
I was a one-year-old when the Dotcom bubble burst, and I was 9 when the Great Recession started.</description></item><item><title>Escaping my age</title><link>https://gadi.fm/posts/age/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:02:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://gadi.fm/posts/age/</guid><description>It’s hard to explain how much my age has wired my sense of self. It’s a source of comfort and how I learned to introduce myself to the world. I don’t like it, I’m certainly a lot more than this number, so I’m breaking out of it.

And I am hoping that writing, and being vulnerable, will help me discover what I have disconnected myself from.
In these last months I have grown immensely as a person, I have discovered and improved parts of who I am that have always challenged me the greatest. I am more tolerant, more patient, learned to be kinder, to be more selfish, to prioritize my needs, and to love myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
